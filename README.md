# NewsAnalytics
News analytics refers to making analysis of the daily news to categorize into some insightful data. Being able to express news stories as numbers permits the manipulation of everyday information in a statistical  way that allows computers not only to make decisions once made only by humans, but to do so more  efficiently. 

Key Milestones in the project

Step 1: Research on finding out news patterns
Step 1: Develop WebCrawler 
Step 2: Filtering data generated 
Step 3:  Separating data into words, text and url
Step 4: Saving in a text file with filtered â€“ relevant, distinct, stopwords removed
Step 5: Displaying news to the user allowing him to select his interested news
Step 6: Finding out the word generated from the interested news and showing the user news urls with the word contained in it
Step 7: Developing Test Cases

How was data filtered:

Filter out URL which contain 2016 
Split the URL based based on word, text and URL where
for eg: Consider the following URL http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2016/04/biomedicine_facing_a_worse_replication_crisis_than_the_one_plaguing_psychology.html

Word: Biomedicine, facing, worse, replication, plaguing, psychology

Text: biomedicine_facing_a_worse_replication_crisis_than_the_one_plaguing_psychology

URL: http://www.slate.com
