            <p>  Victory for Unions as Supreme Court, Scalia Gone, Ties 4-4. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday handed organized labor a major victory, deadlocking 4 to 4 in a case that had threatened to cripple the ability of public unions to collect fees from workers who chose not to join and did not want to pay for the unions’ collective bargaining activities.</p>

            <p> Donald Trump isn’t retreating on Corey Lewandowski. He’s tripling down.We know that Donald Trump revises his positions on things at a moment's notice. We've already documented 20 times Trump had changed his position on things since June -- and that was published last August. Who even knows how many times it has happened since.

            <p>he last thing the iPhone-maker wanted was to set a precedent that allowed law enforcement to force tech companies to undermine their own security. By fighting the FBI's push to compel Apple engineers to write software that would circumvent Farook's passcode, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook framed his company as taking a principled fight for privacy in the digital age. With Monday's news, Apple keeps its principles intact and sends a message that it will stand up for customer security.</p>
